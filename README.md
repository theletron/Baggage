Baggage is a modern open-source alternative to Roblox's default backpack. Baggage aims to be more customizable and easier to use than the default backpack while still having a vanilla feel.

Baggage is a fork of [Satchel](satchel).

Installation of Baggage is as simple as dropping the module into your game and setting up a few properties if you like to customize it. It has a familiar feel and structure as to the default backpack for ease of use for both developers and players.

## ‚≠ê Features

Baggage looks similar to [Roblox's new Chrome UI](devforum-chromeui), while still retaining the original functionality of the built-in backpack.
